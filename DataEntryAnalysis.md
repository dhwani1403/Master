_**Pond 2010**_

* Parameters for Temperature and Depth is not mentioned
* some data is missing for depth Z, Temp, density, colony Diamete
* Time of sample taken is not given as their density changes from day to night
* Row 18 & 19 (Pond 2010)- F0r the same date , depth, temp Density for cuni is less even for almost same Colony diameter (3.23 & 3.28), may sample taken time is different but it is not mention in the given data
* Temp data is missing for depth 50 for Date 6/18/2010 (row 31)


**_Zoop-temp-main_**

* Row 29- for depth 50 meter temp is quite higher in comparision to row 30 for same same date and depth
* Row 32 & 34 are conflicting as there is difference between desity of species per liter for the same depth, colony diameter and temperature


**_Zoop-temp_**

* Data can not be negative , it must be either positive or 0 (row 20)
